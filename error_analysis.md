# Docker Container Checkpoint/Restore Analysis

Looking at the full CRIU log output from the test, here are the key errors and issues in understandable terms:

## Primary Errors Identified

### 1. **Mount Namespace Issues**
```
Error (criu/mount.c:48): mnt: BUG at criu/mount.c:48
```
- **What it means**: CRIU hit an internal bug when trying to handle the container's mount namespace
- **Why it happens**: Docker containers have complex mount setups that CRIU can't handle properly
- **Result**: Segmentation fault (crash) during restore

### 2. **External Mount Detection**
```
Mount 390:(null) is autodetected external mount. Try "--ext-mount-map auto" to allow them.
```
- **What it means**: CRIU found Docker's bind mounts (`/etc/hosts`, `/etc/hostname`, `/etc/resolv.conf`) but doesn't know how to handle them
- **Why it happens**: These are Docker-managed files that exist outside the container's filesystem
- **Solution**: Added `AutoExtMnt: true` (equivalent to `--ext-mount-map auto`)

### 3. **Network Configuration Conflicts**
```
Error: ipv4: Address already assigned.
Error: ipv6: address already assigned.
```
- **What it means**: When restoring, CRIU tried to assign IP addresses that are already in use
- **Why it happens**: The host network still has the same IP configurations
- **Impact**: Network restore partially fails but continues

## Root Cause Analysis

The fundamental issue is that **Docker containers are too complex for direct CRIU restore**:

1. **Complex Mount Tree**: Docker creates 20+ mount points with overlays, bind mounts, and special filesystems
2. **Namespace Conflicts**: Trying to restore into a different container creates namespace mismatches
3. **Resource Conflicts**: Network IPs, cgroups, and other resources are already allocated

## Why This Approach Has Limitations

The direct CRIU approach works for **checkpoint** but fails for **restore** because:
- **Checkpoint**: Just saves the state of an existing process
- **Restore**: Needs to recreate the exact same environment, which is nearly impossible with Docker's complexity

## Successful Approaches (Like Cedana)

Real-world solutions typically:
1. **Use Docker's native API** for both checkpoint and restore
2. **Handle only the application state**, not the full container environment
3. **Accept limitations** and work within Docker's constraints
4. **Use specialized tools** like Kubernetes checkpointing or container migration systems

The errors show why implementing container checkpoint/restore from scratch is extremely challenging - it's not just about CRIU, but about recreating Docker's entire container environment perfectly.
